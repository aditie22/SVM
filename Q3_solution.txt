Q3. How does increasing the value of epsilon affect the number of support vectors in SVR?
In Support Vector Rgression (SVR), the parameter epsilon, denoted as E,is a hypermeter that determines the width of the margin around the regression line are considered to be "in the margin" and do not contribute to the loss function of the SVR.
In general, increasing the value of E tends to decrease the number of support vectors in an SVR. This is because a larger value of E allows for more data points to be "in the margin" and therefore not contribute to the loss function. As a result, SVR has less need to fit the training data closely and can instead focus on finding a simpler, more generizable solution that may have fewer support vectors.
However, the relationship between E and number of support vectors is not always straightforward and can depend on other factors such as complexity of the data and the choice of kernel function. In some cases, increasing E too much may lead to underfitting and poor performance on test data, while setting E too small may result in overfitting and high variance.
Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate value of E based on characterisitcs of data and performance of SVR on validation data. This can often be using techniques such as cross-validation or grid search to explore different values of E and other hypermeters and evaluate their impact on the performance of the SVR.
